Introduction
Hello everyone! We're Team Alpha, and we're excited to share our journey in developing an innovative 
AI/ML solution for predicting early dialysis needs in ICU patients with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). 
Our project represents a critical intersection of advanced machine learning techniques and urgent 
clinical decision-making in intensive care settings.We're here to discuss our amazing experience of 
building an AI/ML solution on enterprise servers - IBM Z systems before, during, and after the datathon.


The Problem
Let's dive into our critical healthcare project: predicting early dialysis needs for ICU patients with 
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). This is a pressing challenge in intensive care settings where timing is everything.

Why is this important? When patients develop AKI in the ICU, medical teams face a crucial dilemma: 
initiating dialysis too early risks unnecessary intervention, while starting too late could be life-threatening. 
Currently, this decision relies heavily on manual monitoring and individual judgment, making it susceptible to 
delays and variations in care.

The challenge is compounded by the sheer volume of patient data that needs to be analyzed in real-time -
 from vital signs to laboratory results. Our goal was to develop a machine learning solution that could 
 process this complex data and provide timely, accurate predictions to support medical decision-making.
This isn't just about building a model; it's about potentially saving lives through better-timed interventions 
and more efficient resource allocation in critical care settings.


The Dataset
Our project utilizes a comprehensive ICU patient dataset specifically curated for AKI prediction. 
The dataset encompasses various critical medical parameters routinely monitored in intensive care settings, 
including vital signs, laboratory test results, and clinical assessments. Through careful preprocessing and 
cleaning, we transformed the raw medical data into a structured format suitable for machine learning applications. 
Given the nature of medical data, where patients requiring early dialysis intervention are typically fewer in 
number, we implemented specialized sampling techniques to address this class imbalance.
To solve the class imbalance problem, we employed two complementary approaches:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to create synthetic samples of the minority class 
(patients requiring early dialysis)
Class weights in our models (using class_weight='balanced') to assign higher penalties for misclassifying the 
minority class

Here's our comprehensive preprocessing implementation:

# Step 1: Data Preprocessing Pipeline
# Create preprocessor for different types of features
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_columns),
    ('cat', OneHotEncoder(drop='first', sparse_output=False), categorical_columns)
])

# Step 2: Feature Selection
feature_selector = SelectFromModel(
    RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    max_features=20
)

# Step 3: Complete Pipeline with SMOTE and Class Weights
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('feature_selector', feature_selector),
    ('smote', SMOTE(random_state=42)),
    # Using class_weight='balanced' in addition to SMOTE
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression(random_state=42, class_weight='balanced'))
])

# Step 4: Define Hyperparameter Space
param_grid = {
    'classifier__C': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'classifier__penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],
    'classifier__solver': ['liblinear', 'saga'],
    'classifier__max_iter': [1000]
}


Model Implementation:

In our AKI prediction project, we implemented a comprehensive suite of machine learning models to predict early 
dialysis needs in ICU patients. 
Our approach utilized four key models: 
Logistic Regression, which provided interpretable results with cross-validated hyperparameter tuning; 

Random Forest, which captured complex feature interactions and helped identify influential AKI predictors; 

XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting technique that significantly improved performance through grid search 
optimization;  

Ensemble Techniques that combined multiple models using a voting classifier for enhanced prediction accuracy. 

Each model underwent rigorous evaluation using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, 
and ROC AUC, ensuring robust and reliable predictions. The practical implementation included a user-friendly 
prediction function that takes key medical parameters (calcium levels, creatinine, AKI stage, anion gap, and PT max) 
as inputs and provides clear recommendations for early dialysis intervention. 
This multi-model approach allowed us to leverage the strengths of different algorithms while maintaining 
clinical applicability, ultimately creating a robust system for supporting critical care decisions.


Deploying to IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud (L1CC):

The deployment phase marked an exciting transition for our AKI prediction project. 
The IBM Z platform proved to be the perfect environment for operationalizing our AKI prediction models. 
Thanks to IBM Z's compatibility with open standards, we could seamlessly transfer our trained models 
(Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ensemble models) to the L1CC environment.

The performance on L1CC was remarkable - our model's inference time was consistently under a second, 
significantly faster than local machine performance. This made our AKI prediction system highly efficient 
for clinical settings where quick decisions are crucial. The successful deployment on L1CC demonstrated the 
technical feasibility of our system for real-world medical applications where timely predictions can make a 
significant difference in patient care.

Conclusion:

Overall, our journey in developing the Early Dialysis Prediction system has been both challenging and rewarding. 
By implementing multiple machine learning approaches - from Logistic Regression to XGBoost and ensemble methods 
- we successfully created a robust system for predicting dialysis needs in ICU patients with AKI. 
Our solution effectively handles the complexities of medical data preprocessing, class imbalance, and 
feature selection while maintaining the high accuracy needed for clinical applications.

Looking ahead, we aim to enhance our system with expanded datasets and more rigorous clinical validation. 
For now, we're proud to have developed a solution that could potentially assist medical professionals in making 
timely decisions about dialysis intervention. We extend our thanks to all who supported this project and helped 
us understand the critical aspects of AKI prediction in healthcare settings.

Until next time,
